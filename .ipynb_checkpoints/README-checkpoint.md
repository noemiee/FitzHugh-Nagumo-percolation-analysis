## Notebook content: 

Performs integration of a system consisting of diffusively coupled stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators on a 1D lattice with periodic boundary conditions:

$$
\begin{split}
&\epsilon\dot{u} = f(u) - v + I \\
&\dot{v}=u-bv+c \ ,
\end{split}
$$
where $f(u) = \alpha u(u-a)(1-u)$.

Compute a time-dependent functional network describing the evolution of correlations in the system.
Compute and analyze evolution of percolation measures on the time-dependent network.
